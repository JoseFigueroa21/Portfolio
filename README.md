# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! I'm Jose Figueroa, a skilled data analyst / data visualization specialist, and this repository showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of data analytics. Below, you'll find an overview of each project and a brief description of the work involved.

## Project 1: Data Professional Survey (June 2023)

In this project, I present my background as a data analyst and data visualization specialist. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University Bakersfield and possess a diverse skill set that includes programming languages, database management, data visualization, statistical analysis, and probability. My passion for leveraging data to uncover insights and drive informed decision-making motivates me to excel in any role that requires a strong analytical foundation.

## Project 2: Music Artist Database (May 2023)

For the "Music Artist Database" project, I designed and implemented a database to store information about music artists and their albums. The database consists of two tables: "artist" and "album." I used SQL queries to insert data, retrieve artists and albums, and perform various data analysis tasks. The project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and database management, enabling me to handle complex data structures effectively.

## Project 3: Book Store (April 2023)

In the "Book Store" project, I created a book store database using SQL. The database includes a table named "BookStore" with columns such as 'id', 'title', 'author', 'genre', and 'price'. I inserted book items into the table and utilized SQL queries with 'ORDER BY' and 'AVG()' functions to retrieve and analyze the data. This project showcases my ability to design and manage databases to enhance user experience and gain valuable insights from the data.

## Project 4: Car Accidents in the US (March 2023)

The "Car Accidents in the US" project involved data analysis and manipulation using the pandas library in Python. I cleaned and explored a dataset containing information on US accidents, performing tasks such as data loading, cleaning, and statistical analysis. This project highlights my expertise in using pandas to handle data, derive meaningful insights, and present the results in a clear and concise manner.

## Project 5: Video Games Sales & Ranking (December 2022)

For the "Video Games Sales & Ranking" project, I utilized the R programming language and various packages to analyze statistical data. I visualized the global sales distribution using a histogram and assessed the normality assumption of the data with a quantile-quantile plot. Additionally, I conducted a linear regression analysis to explore the relationship between global sales and rankings. This project demonstrates my proficiency in using R for data analysis and statistical modeling.
